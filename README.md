> ## 🛠️ Getting Started: Unveiling the Enchantment

Embarking on this enchanting journey requires a meticulous initiation:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/Ghost-Hackers.bot.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Discord Bot Token**

   Obtain a Discord bot token by creating a new application and bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

4. **Craft `.env`**

   Craft a `.env` file, imbuing it with your Discord bot tokens.

   ```python
   {
       # Install the python-dotenv library
       # pip install python-dotenv

       # In your code
       import os
       from dotenv import load_dotenv

       # Load environment variables from .env
       load_dotenv()

       # Access Discord Bot Credentials
       discord_bot_token = os.getenv("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
       discord_client_id = os.getenv("YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
       discord_client_secret = os.getenv("YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
   }
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"` with the actual bot token.

5. **Run the Bot**

   Conjure the bot with the following command:

   ```bash
   run_DiscordBot.bat
   ```

6. **Invite the Bot**

   Invite the bot to your server with the following link:

   ```text
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"` with the actual client ID of your Discord bot.

> ## 🛠️ Getting Started: Setting Up Embedded Python

To ensure a consistent Python environment for the project, we include an embedded Python distribution. Follow the steps below to set up the [embedded Python](python_embed\python-3.12.1-amd64.zip) on your machine:

### Step 1: **Download and Install Embedded Python**

1. **Open the Downloads Folder:** Locate your Downloads folder on your machine.
2. **Move and Extract Python Installer:**
    - Move `python-3.12.1-amd64.zip` to the Downloads folder.
    - Extract the contents of the zip file into the Downloads folder.
    - Run the installer to automatically set up Python, or choose the custom install option.

### Step 2: **Verify Installation**

Open a new command prompt or terminal window and run the following commands to verify the installation:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version matching the embedded distribution.

### Step 3: **Run Your Project**

Now that the embedded Python is set up, you're ready to run your project. Use the following command to execute your main script:

```bash
python path_to_repository\Ghost-Hackers.bot\main.py
```

   Replace `path_to_repository` with the actual path to the repository on your machine.
